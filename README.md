# Project

This is a UI mockup of the YieldStreet support center page - [YieldStreet Support Center](https://www.yieldstreet.com/support-center)

## Technologies Used

This project was built with React, Styled Components, Bootstrap 4, and Webpack.

## Please Keep In Mind

I am using Bootstrap 4, as opposed to the current YieldStreet website which uses Bootstrap 3. The two versions have different breakpoints for xs which will make minor inconsistencies when comparing my project directly with yours on xs browser width.

Also, due to the four hour time constraint I did not test but I am interested to hear more about how YieldStreet utilizes enzyme or any other testing utility.

Lastly, I repeated some FAQs in the interest of time. Also, the HTML I used in my Data.js is all from your current website. I later parse it out and render it in the FAQ section.
